## SWMS (Smart Waste Management System)
* Key Areas: IOT, Cloud Computing, Route Optimization, Waste Management.

This project proposes a smart waste management system for smart cities called (SWMS). The main
objective of the project is to provide an efficient waste collection method, the collection companies
will be able to keep the city always clean in the most cost-effective manner.

Using IOT (internet of things) devices to collect waste bins data which make us totally aware of
the real-time status of the waste bins, using this data. The system will generate dynamic schedule
for the collectors, and furthermore, the system will provide routing service for each ride the
collectors make. All the system data will be stored on the cloud which makes it easier to control
backups, save costs, and recover data. Flexibility, Security, and the advantages of the available
services on the cloud.

The system will generate the dynamic schedule in a way that ensure to keep the city clean since
the system will inform the collector with new schedule whenever the number of full or toxic bins
exceed specific limit or specific bins has been full for more than specific time limit or in case of
toxic bin that need an urgent clean, this method will guarantee that city will always be clean. The
optimized route to the bins that need to be collected will minimize the transportation cost and time.
The system will handle some cases to ensure effective collection such as ignoring the empty, halffull bins.
